# WHAT DOES "SECTION ANALYSIS" MEAN
- "section analysis" breaks a song into big sections, each around 10 secs to a minute long, and provides different, relevant metrics that distinguish one section from another, such as the tempo/BPM and the key of the section. 

- when you listen to a song, usually there are 3 to 5 major sections of it: the beginning which has low BPM, the climax which has high BPM and usually has lyrics, and other sections with different bpms and moods. this program breaks the song into these sections and prints the metrics for each section.
