WHAT DOES "SECTION ANALYSIS" MEAN

"segment analysis" breaks a song into very small segments. A segment is a musical unit within a track, often comprising a few musical bars. A segment has the same timbre, loudness, and pitches, and different segments have different metrics for them.

Segments represent a micro-level analysis,like pages in a book, focusing on the detailed acoustic properties of the music.
